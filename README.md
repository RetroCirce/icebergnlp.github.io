Instructions for updating the publication page
--------

You'll need [Jekyll][] and [bibble][] (`pip install bibble`).

To make changes to the [publication page](https://icebergnlp.github.io/publications.html):
 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Modify [`bib/berglab-pubs.bib`](bib/berglab-pubs.bib) as needed.
 3. Running `make` from the repo's main directory will regenerate the [`_includes/pubs.html`](_includes/pubs.html) page.
 4. To serve the website locally on your machine, run `make serve`. You'll be able to view the local version at `http://127.0.0.1:5002`.
 5. To deploy, commit and push your changes to the `master` branch.

Comments on formatting:
 * Papers are sorted by the `month` field in the BibTeX entries. If no month is listed (or the `month` field is not parsed correctly), the paper will appear at the end of the list for the corresponding year. So far we've been adding the month manually to all papers except preprints.
 * For papers in the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/), best practice is to copy the BibTeX entries directly from the Anthology ([like this](https://twitter.com/aclanthology/status/1409538891108003840)).
 * Equal authorship stars need to be marked directly in the `author` field, e.g. `author = "Ryskina*, Maria  and Berg-Kirkpatrick*, Taylor"`
 * Remove TeX formatting like `{}` or `^` from titles. Write special characters and diacritics directly in the BibTeX entry (e.g. write `รถ` instead of `\"{o}`).
 * The venue name is displayed directly from the `booktitle` or `journal` field, so modify these fields accordingly in the Bib file. We've been shortening names and listing abbreviations for all conferences and workshops.
 * Make sure you add the link to the paper (if available) as the `url` field in the BibTeX entry.

Research Group Web Site Template
================================

This is a [Jekyll][]-based Web site intended for research groups. Your group should be able to get up and running with minimal fuss.

Features
--------

* Thanks to [Jekyll][], content is just text files. So even faculty should be able to figure it out.
* Publications list generated from BibTeX.
* Personnel list. Organize your professors, students, staff, and alumni.
* Combined news stream and blog posts.
* Easily extensible navigation bar.
* Responsive (mobile-ready) design based on [Bootstrap][].

Setup
-----

1. Install the dependencies. You will need [Python][], [bibble][] (`pip install bibble`), and [Jekyll][] (`gem install jekyll`).
2. [Fork][] this repository on GitHub.
3. Clone the fork to your own machine: `git clone git@github.com:yourgroup/research-group-web.git`.
4. Add an "upstream" remote for the original repository so you can stay abreast of bugfixes: `git remote add upstream git://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web.git`.
5. Customize. Start with the `_config.yml` file, where you enter the name of the site and its URL.
6. Type `make` to build the site and then run `make serve` to view your site.
7. Keep adding content. See below for instructions for each of the various sections.
8. Periodically pull from the upstream repository: `git pull upstream master`.

Publication List
----------------

The list of publications is in `bib/pubs.bib`. Typing `make` will generate `pubs.html`, which contains a pretty, sorted HTML-formatted list of papers. The public page, `publications.html`, also has a link to download the original BibTeX.


News Items and Blog Posts
-------------------------

For both long-form blog posts and short news updates, we use Jekyll's blogging system. To post a new item of either type, you create a file in the `_posts` directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title-for-url.md`. The date part of the filename always matters; the title part is currently only used for full blog posts (but is still required for news updates).

The file must begin with [YAML front matter][yfm]. For news updates, use this:

    ---
    layout: post
    shortnews: true
    ---

For full blog posts, use this format:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "Some Great Title Here"
    ---

And concoct a page title for your post. The body of the post goes after the `---` in either case.

You can also customize the icon that is displayed on the news feed. By default it's `newspaper-o`. We use icons from the [FontAwesome][fa] icon set.

Projects
--------

To create a project, just create a markdown file in the `_projects` folder. Here are the things you can put in the YAML frontmatter:

- `title:` The project title.
- `notitle:` Set this to `true` if you don't want a title displayed on the project card. Optional.
- `description:` The text shown in the project card. It supports markdown.
- `people:` The people working on the project. This is a list of keys from the `_data/people.yml` file.
- `layout: project` This sets the layout of the actual project page. It should be set to `project`.
- `image:` The URL of an image for the project. This is shown on both the project page and the project card. Optional.
- `last-updated:` Date in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`. The project cards are sorted by this, most recent first.
- `status: inactive` Set this to `inactive` if don't want the project to appear on the front page. Just ignore it otherwise.
- `link:` Set this to an external URL if this project has a page somewhere else on the web. If you don't have a `link:`, then the content of this markdown file (below the YAML frontmatter) will be this project's page.
- `no-link: true` Set this if you just don't want a project page for your project.

Personnel
---------

People are listed in a [YAML][] file in `_data/people.yml`. You can list the name, link, bio, and role of each person. Roles (e.g., "Faculty", "Staff", and "Students") are defined in `_config.yml`.

Building
--------

The requirements for building the site are:

* [Jekyll][]: run `gem install jekyll`
* [bibble][]: available on `pip`
* ssh and rsync, only if you want to deploy directly.

`make` compiles the bibliography and the website content to the `_site`
directory. To preview the site, run `jekyll serve`` and head to
http://0.0.0.0:5000.


Deploying to Your Sever
-----------------------

To set up deployments, edit the Makefile and look for the lines where `HOST` and `DIR` are defined. Change these to the host where your HTML files should be copied to.

To upload a new version of the site via rsync over ssh, type `make deploy`. A web hook does this automatically when you push to GitHub. Be aware that the Makefile is configured to have rsync delete stray files from the destination directory.
